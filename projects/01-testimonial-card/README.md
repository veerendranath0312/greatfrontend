A clean, responsive, and reusable testimonial card component.

## 💭 My Notes

Although the challenge offered Tailwind as an option, I chose to use **vanilla CSS** to strengthen my understanding of the fundamentals.

- **Layout:** I used Flexbox to align the profile image with the text content.
- **Variables:** I used CSS Variables (Custom Properties) for colors to make the code maintainable without needing a pre-processor.
- **Reset:** I implemented a minimal CSS reset to ensure consistency across browsers.
